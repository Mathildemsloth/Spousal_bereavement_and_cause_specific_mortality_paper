**Software**

R version 4.2.3 was used for the data preprocessing and statistical modelling. The matching was done using the package MatchIt [1, 2]. For the ATE the package riskRegression [3] was used. In the prediction modelling process the packages xgboost [4, 5], tidymodels [6], finetune [7], and cvurves [8] were used.
